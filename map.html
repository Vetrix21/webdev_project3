    <section><h2>Locations</h2>
      <p>Three locations important to me have been added into this map.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Armour Tringle</strong> — I am a member,, and on the executive board of, Armour Triangle. The house is where I live during the semester, and many memories and bonds have been made here.</li>
        <li><strong>Smith Park</strong> — In middle school, my friends and I went to a summer camp at this park. I remember biking past this tank every weekday, and after we outgrew the camp we used the park as a base whenever we hung out, meeting up here before walking around the neighborhood looking for somewhere to sit and eat.</li>
        <li><strong>Bottom Lounge</strong> — My favorite music venue in Chicago. I enjoy both attending concerts and playing them at this venue; with my band I have played here twice, and this is my favorite stage that I have played on. The venue itself is a good vibe for metal, and the food is also good here.</li>
